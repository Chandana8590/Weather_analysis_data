# Weather-Data-API 🌦️

This project collects real-time weather data from OpenWeather API, stores it in AWS DynamoDB and S3, and ingests it into Snowflake using Snowpipe.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon S3
- DynamoDB
- Snowflake
- Python
- SQL

🔁 Step-by-Step Process

🌦 OpenWeather API    -> Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities.

🔗 EventBridge       -> Detects when new data is available and triggers the flow.

🧠 Lambda (1st)      -> Fetches and processes the weather data.

🪣 S3 + 📘 DynamoDB -> Data is saved in S3 for storage and in DynamoDB for structured access.

📊 DynamoDB Stream   -> Lambda (2nd) When DynamoDB is updated, it triggers another Lambda function.

📥 Lambda (2nd) → S3  -> This Lambda stores transformed data into S3 again.

🔑 IAM + Integration Gears -> Provides secure access between S3 and Snowflake using roles.

📩 SQS              -> Notifies Snowflake when new data is in S3.

📤 External Stage + Snowpipe  -> Snowflake reads the file from S3 via the external stage, and Snowpipe loads it automatically.

❄️ SnowflakeDB    ->  Data is stored in a Snowflake database.

📈 Power BI  -> Uses Snowflake data to create dashboards and visual reports.
